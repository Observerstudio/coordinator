# General checks

Valid in every repo. Score each PASS / FAIL / N/A with one line of evidence. The repo's own checks
(`docs/agents/review-standards.md`) are scored on top, in the same shape.

| # | Check | Evidence |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Spec match** | Scored against the brief's `.feature` file: every `Scenario:` title is, verbatim, the `it()` title of a test that is green in the gate run, or the PR states the deferral. No `.feature` for a code-writing lane means the brief was wrong, not the lane: fix the brief, then score. Name the scenario that is missing. |
| 2 | **Meaning, not just safety** | For any closed set of verdicts, classifications or statuses: one POSITIVE fixture per member exists and the healthy path asserts the *clean* verdict. A negative control proves nothing about meaning. |
| 3 | **Mutation controls bite** | The PR body pastes red output for each guard, and each control kills exactly the guard it claims. A guard with a redundant sibling says so: a single mutation can survive a redundant guard. |
| 4 | **Diff hygiene** | `git diff --numstat` per file is proportional to the change. Whole-file rewrites (CRLF loss, `prisma format`, reformatters) FAIL. Schema changes are additive and small. |
| 5 | **Repo rules held** | Every rule the repo's review-standards file points at (its `AGENTS.md` hard rules and engineering standards): name each one the diff touches and whether it held. A refactor PR that changes behaviour, an edit in place of an append, an outbound call with no timeout, a second derivation of one fact, or a cross-area import outside the published index FAILs here. |
| 6 | **What it deletes** | The PR names what it removes or corrects (a wrong comment, a dead test, a superseded guard); "nothing" is acceptable only when stated. Run `ponytail-review` against the PR diff: an abstraction with one caller, a guard for a caller that does not exist, or a helper the stdlib already provides FAILs here. |

## When a check fails

- FAIL on 2 → rework before the gate.
- FAIL on 4 → rework (cheap, and it protects every other branch).
- FAIL on 1, 3, 5, 6 → rework unless the gap is stated in the PR body and accepted in the gate comment.
- The repo's own checks carry the rule the repo gives them.
